/*
 * TODO: Here is the plan of record for SkUniformData
 *    allocate them (and their ancillary data in an arena - and rm SkRefCnt
 *    allow a scratch buffer to be used to collect the uniform data when processing a PaintParams
 *       - this can be reset for each draw and be copied into a cache if it needs to be preserved
 *    if possible, clear out the cache (and delete the arena) once the DrawPass is created/the
 *               uniforms are copied into a buffer
 *       - this will mean we'll get w/in DrawPass reuse but not cross-DrawPass reuse
 *       - we could also explore getting w/in a Recording (i.e. cross-DrawPass) and w/in a
 *               Recorder reuse (i.e., cross-Recordings, but single-threaded)
 *    have the SkUniformData's data layout match what is required by the DrawList so we can just
 *               copy it into the buffer
